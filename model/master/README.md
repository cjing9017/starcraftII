# StarCraft

This is a pytorch implementation of the multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms, including [QMIX](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.11485), [VDN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.05296), [COMA](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08926), and [QTRAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.05408)(both QTRAN-base and QTRAN-alt), which are the state of art MARL algorithms. In addition, we implemented [CommNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07736) and combined it with coma, which we called CommNet_COMA. We trained these algorithms on [SMAC](https://github.com/oxwhirl/smac), the decentralised micromanagement scenario of [StarCraft II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StarCraft_II:_Wings_of_Liberty).

## Quick Start

```shell
$ python main.py --evaluate_epoch=100 --map=3m --alg=qmix
```

Directly run the main.py, then the algorithm will be tested on map '3m' for 100 episodes, using the pretrained model.

## Result

We independently train these algorithms for 8 times and take the mean of the 8 independent results. In order to make the curves smoother, we also take the mean of every five points in the horizontal direction. In each independent training process, we train these algorithms for 5000 epochs and evaluate them for every 5 epochs. From the figure 1 we can see that our results is not the same as in the papers, maybe there are some small bugs, we are pleasure that you pull request to improve this project. Furthermore, as show in figure 2, we compare the best result we think in the 8 independent results. All of the results are saved in './result'.
