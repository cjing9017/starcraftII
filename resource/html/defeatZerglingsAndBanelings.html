<h2>DefeatZerglingsAndBanelings</h2>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>A map with 9 Marines on the opposite side from a group of 6 Zerglings and 4
Banelings. Rewards are earned by using the Marines to defeat Zerglings and
Banelings. Whenever all Zerglings and Banelings have been defeated, a new group
of 6 Zerglings and 4 Banelings is spawned and the player is awarded 4 additional
Marines at full health, with all other surviving Marines retaining their
existing health (no restore). Whenever new units are spawned, all unit positions
are reset to opposite sides of the map.</p>

<li>This map and DefeatRoaches are currently the only maps in the set that can
    include an automatic, mid-episode state change for player-controlled units.
    The Marine units are automatically moved back to a neutral position (at a
    random side of the map opposite the Roaches) when new units are spawned,
    which occurs whenever the current set of Zerglings and Banelings is
    defeated. This is done in order to guarantee that new units do not spawn
    within combat range of one another.</li>
