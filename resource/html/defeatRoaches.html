<h2>DefeatRoaches</h2>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>A map with 9 Marines and a group of 4 Roaches on opposite sides. Rewards are
earned by using the Marines to defeat Roaches, with optimal combat strategy
requiring the Marines to perform focus fire on the Roaches. Whenever all 4
Roaches have been defeated, a new group of 4 Roaches is spawned and the player
is awarded 5 additional Marines at full health, with all other surviving Marines
retaining their existing health (no restore). Whenever new units are spawned,
all unit positions are reset to opposite sides of the map.</p>

<li>This map and DefeatZerglingsAndBanelings are currently the only maps in the
    set that can include an automatic, mid-episode state change for
    player-controlled units. The Marine units are automatically moved back to a
    neutral position (at a random side of the map opposite the Roaches) when new
    units are spawned, which occurs whenever the current set of Roaches is
    defeated. This is done in order to guarantee that new units do not spawn
    within combat range of one another.</li>
